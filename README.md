# Breast-Cancer-Machine-learning-Model-With-Accuracy-99.12-
• Developed a machine learning model to classify Breast Cancer whether it's Benign or Malignant. 
• Applied 3 algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVC,Random Forest) as they are the most suitable for this dataset. 
• Implemented all feature scaling techniques (Min Max, Standard, Robust) to check what's the most appropiate technique for this dataset by showing the accuracy 
of each technique on the 3 models. 
# What I have come into through this project :
• SVC was the best model among all 3 applied models as it gives the highest test accuracy 99.12 %.
• Robust Scaler was the best feature scaling technique , as it has transformed test accuracy using SVC from  92.98 % to 99.12 % . 
• Model doesn't suffer from Overfitting  as Trainning Accuracy is 98.24 % and Testing Accuracy is 99.12 %.
